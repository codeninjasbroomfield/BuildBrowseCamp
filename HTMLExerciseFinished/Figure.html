		<h1>Garden of Gods</h1>
		<p>
			Garden of the Gods Park is a registered National Natural Landmark. Imagine dramatic views, 300' towering sandstone rock formations against a backdrop of snow-capped Pikes Peak and brilliant blue skies. This world-class Visitor & Nature Center and museum is the most visited attraction in the region with all new interactive exhibits. Learn how the amazing red rocks got there with the NEW Geo-Trekker theater experience, shown every 20 minutes. Delight in one of Colorado's most photographed views while eating in our glass-enclosed caf√© or from our terrace overlooking Pikes Peak and Garden of the Gods. Where else can you eat inside a postcard?
